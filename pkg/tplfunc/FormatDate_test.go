ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=FormatDate_83db4f45d0

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-248: Uncaught Exception
Issue: The function formatDate() uses panic() in case of invalid arguments. This can crash the application, leading to denial of service.
Solution: Instead of panic(), return an error to the caller function and handle it gracefully.

Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The function formatDate() casts an integer to int64 without checking. This can lead to integer overflow if a large value is passed as argument.
Solution: Perform a range check before casting the integer to int64.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs
Issue: The function formatDate() uses an untrusted input directly as a format string. This can lead to format string attacks.
Solution: Validate the format string before using it in time.Format() function.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful formatting of date with a single argument

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly formats a Unix timestamp into a date string using the default format when only one argument is provided.
Execution:
    Arrange: A Unix timestamp, such as 1631827840 (which represents September 16, 2021, 19:04:00 UTC), is prepared.
    Act: The target function is invoked with the prepared Unix timestamp.
    Assert: The Go testing facilities are used to verify if the returned string matches the expected date string "20210916190400" (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS).
Validation:
    The assertion choice is straightforward because the Unix timestamp is converted to a specific date string format. The test is important as it verifies the basic functionality of the function under normal operation.

Scenario 2: Successful formatting of date with two arguments

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly formats a Unix timestamp into a date string using a custom format when two arguments are provided.
Execution:
    Arrange: A Unix timestamp, such as 1631827840, and a custom date string format, such as "2006-01-02 15:04:05", are prepared.
    Act: The target function is invoked with the prepared Unix timestamp and date string format.
    Assert: The Go testing facilities are used to verify if the returned string matches the expected date string "2021-09-16 19:04:00".
Validation:
    The assertion choice is based on the expectation that the Unix timestamp is converted to a date string using the provided custom format. This test is important as it verifies the function's flexibility in handling different date string formats.

Scenario 3: Panic with no arguments

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function panics when no arguments are provided.
Execution:
    Arrange: No arguments are prepared.
    Act: The target function is invoked with no arguments.
    Assert: The Go testing facilities are used to verify if a panic occurs with the message "formatDate() requires at least 1 argument".
Validation:
    The assertion choice is based on the expectation that the function panics when no arguments are provided. This test is important as it verifies the function's error handling capabilities.

Scenario 4: Panic with more than two arguments

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function panics when more than two arguments are provided.
Execution:
    Arrange: Three arguments are prepared.
    Act: The target function is invoked with the three arguments.
    Assert: The Go testing facilities are used to verify if a panic occurs with the message "formatDate() requires at most 2 arguments".
Validation:
    The assertion choice is based on the expectation that the function panics when more than two arguments are provided. This test is important as it verifies the function's error handling capabilities.
